Building out a GoodReads clone.

You can add books to your booklist and then view them under "My Books."

I only have a few hundred books in the system - you can add more in the "Admin" tab.

I've kept everything in server componets except for user interactions.  

Next steps are to redirect users to login on refresh, and keep current state on refresh... lotta other real world things like that to do!
